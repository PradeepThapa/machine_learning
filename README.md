                        SIT720 Machine Learning

**Assignment 1**

**Purpose**

`This assessment task is for student to apply Python programming skills for loading, visualising, manipulating 
and exporting data using various modules and packages.`

**Assignment 2**

**Purpose**

`This assessment task is for student to apply skills for data 
clustering and dimensionality reduction. Students 
will be required to demonstrate ability in data representation, and
competency in applying suitable  clustering/dimensionality
reduction techniques in a real world scenario.`

**Assignment 3**

**Purpose**

`This assessment task is for students to demonstrate knowledge of linear classification. Students will be 
required to apply L1/L2 regularized logistic regression for a classification task. They will be selecting best hyper 
parameters and testing on their competency in designing accurate parsimonious classifier for a real
world problem.`

**Assignment 5**

**Purpose**

`This assessment is an extensive machine learning project. Students will be given a specific data set for 
analysis and will be required to develop and compare various classification techniques. Each student must 
demonstrate skills acquired in data representation, classification and evaluation.`
